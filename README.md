# Bell-The-Cat

Goal of the game is to make a circle around the cat so that she cant escape!

In this game the cat uses A-star algorithm to find the nearest escape making it tough for the user to beat the cat. I've implemented this as an application of AI in games by giving intelligence to the cat.
